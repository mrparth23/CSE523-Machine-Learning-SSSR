CSE523 Machine Learning SSSR repository contains a movie recommendation system using KNN, ALS and SVD algorithm.

# Movie recommendation system #

## Introduction
We have made a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering where we have used both memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering.
So we implemented 3 algorithms
- K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)<br/>
  It is a memory-based clustering algorithm
  
- Alternating Least Squares(ALS)<br/>
  It is a model-based matrix factorization algorithm 
  
- Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)<br/>
  It is a model-based matrix factorization algorithm
