# Introduction

We have made a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering where we have used both memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering. So we implemented 3 algorithms

*   K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)  
    It is a memory-based clustering algorithm
    
*   Alternating Least Squares(ALS)  
    It is a model-based matrix factorization algorithm
    
*   Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)  
    It is a model-based matrix factorization algorithm
    

# K-Nearest Neighbours

Let's understand how the model is implemented for the KNN algorithm:
